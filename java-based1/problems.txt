Intractable Problems and Approximation Algorithms:

Class of Problems - P, NP, NP-Hard, NP-Complete
Intractability of algorithms
Two perspectives: Optimization and decision problem and their inter-conversion
Abstract problems
Deterministic and 
Strategies to deal with intractability: - Problem reduction, approximation algorithms (vertex cover and tsp)
Examples of simple reductions: (closest pair -> sorting), (longest increasing subsequence -> edit distance), (lcm -> gcd), (sort -> convex hull)
Examples on elementary hardness reductions: (hamiltonian cycle -> tsp),(vertex cover -> independent set),(independent -> clique),(3-SAT -> independent set)
Satisfiability: circuit SAT, Formula SAT (3-CNF)
